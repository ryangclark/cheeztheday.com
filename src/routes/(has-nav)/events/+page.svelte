	Bringing people together is a beautiful thing, and we'd love to help make it
	special. Cheez The Day caters events of all kinds.

	You can cover all, some, or none of the food cost, though minimum event spend
	may apply. <a class="underline" href="/contact">Contact us</a> to learn more (we
	don't bite!).

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 font-museo text-2xl">Neighborhood Gatherings</h2>
<p class="my-2">
	Building community in your own backyard is underrated, and coming together
	around food is a great way to get started. We're favorites with HOAs for
	regular meetups, graduation parties, and more.
</p>

<p class="my-2">
	We'll set up in your driveway or at the local meetup spot, and the grilled
	cheez will grease the wheels. Celebrate, connect, and enjoy.
</p>

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 font-museo text-2xl">Workplace Lunches</h2>
<p class="my-2">
	Wanna treat your crew? Great employees deserve great grilled cheez. We're
	ready to set up the truck at your workplace for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
