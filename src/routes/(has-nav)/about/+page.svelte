<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 font-museo text-2xl">How it started</h2>
<p class="my-2">
	In 2020, Larry and Tony put their lifelong friendship to the test by hopping
	on a tie-dye bus and grilling cheez together. With their wives, Connie and
	Terry, they opened a food truck to bring people across greater Cincinnati
	together over good food, done right, and done cheezy.
</p>
<p class="my-2">
	Being men who enjoy the simple things in life, they came up with a simple
	menu: sandwiches, soups, and salads. But just because the menu's simple
	doesn't mean the food is. Check out
	<a class="underline" href="/menu">our menu</a>.

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 font-museo text-2xl">Did you know?</h2>
<ul class="list-disc">
	<li class="mb-2 ml-6">
		Experts at the helm: Tony is a classically-trained and experienced chef. He
		prefers slingin' sandwiches.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2 ml-6">
		Business-savvy without the tie: Larry has been selling ketchup-popsicles to
		women in white gloves since the day he was born. Bet he'll sell you on that
		Cowboy sandwich &ndash; with all the add-ons &ndash; before you can say
		CHEEZ!
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2 ml-6">
		Elbow grease meets kitchen grease: Tony helped build out the truck himself,
		installing the griddle, welding, and everything in between.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 font-museo text-2xl">FAQ</h2>
<p class="my-2 italic">Can you customize the menu for my event?</p>
<p class="my-2">
	We take our menu pretty seriously. Not in a snobby way or anything, we just
	want to serve food that's affordable, fast, and darn good. That said, we'd be
	happy to hear what you have in mind. <a class="underline" href="/contact"
