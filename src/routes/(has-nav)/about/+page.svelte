<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl">How it started</h2>
<p class="my-2">
	In 2020, Larry and Tony decided to test their lifelong friendship by going
	into business together. With their wives, Connie and Terry, they opened a food
	truck to bring people across Cincinnati together over good food done right.
</p>
<p class="my-2">
	Being simple men, they came up with a simple menu: sandwiches, soups, and
	salads. But just because the menu is simple doesn't mean the food is. Check
	out
